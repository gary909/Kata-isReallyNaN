<p>
    I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script code recently, and I've traced the problem back to the global <br>
    isNaN function I was using. I had expected it to be more discerning, but it's returning true for undefined right now.<br>
    <br>
    Write a function isReallyNaN that returns true only if passed in an argument that evalutes to NaN, and returns <br>
    false otherwise.<br>
    <br>
    Any solution is acceptable!<br>
